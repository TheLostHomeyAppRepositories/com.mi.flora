## Q&amp;A

> **Q1**  Why canâ€™t the sensor be found by Homey?

* _Check if the sensor is connected to another bluetooth device. The  `Xiaomi Mi Flora`  app for example_

> **Q1**  Why are the readings from the sensors different from in the  `Xiaomi Mi Flora`  app?

* _It is caused by old firmware (2.7.0), try to update the sensors through the  `Xiaomi Mi Flora`  app_

> **Q3**  Is the app compatibel with v2.0.0?

* The app is only compatible from v2.1.2 and up due to change to the BLE core.

> **Q4**  Is the app compatibel with SDK 3?

* Yes the app is compatible from v3.0.0

## Usage
1. Install app
2. Add the device(s) to Homey.
3. Configure the threshold in the device configuration.
4. Make a flow with one of the cards.

You can configure the timeout between polls in the app's settings.

## Cards
### Device cards
#### Trigger cards
1. Some device sensor has changed.

   * sensor (Moisture)
   * value (20%)
   * report (The moisture is updated to: 20%.)
3. Sensor value is below the configured threshold.
   * sensor (Moisture)
   * value (20%)
   * report (The moisture (20%) is too low. This can be at least 30%.)
4. Sensor value is above the configured threshold.
   * sensor (Moisture)
   * value (20%)
   * report (The moisture (20%) is too high. This must be a maximum of 15%.)

#### Condition cards
1. De plant has a correct temperature.
2. De plant has enough sunlight.
3. De plant has enough nutrition.
